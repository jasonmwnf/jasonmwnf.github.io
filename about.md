I am a web developer, technology enthusiast and musician. While my web development experience is strongly rooted in the fundamentals of MVC and TDD using Ruby and the Rails framework, my enthusiasm for technology helps to keep me up to date on the latest trends in web development and allows me to continuously add new techniques to my skill set.

I have been interested in computers and technology since I was young, starting with coding games on my Commadore VIC 20, all the way up to learning programming and Computer Science at the University level. After taking some time to explore my interests in music as a performing musician and music educator, I've made the decision to refocus on programming and web development. I look forward to applying the same enthusiasm I had as a child to any technological opportunity that comes my way. I am now, more than ever, MOTIVATED to change my life and to write great code!

Feel free to reach out and contact me. I look forward to it!
